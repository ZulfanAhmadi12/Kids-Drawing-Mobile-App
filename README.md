## About Kids Drawing App, Kotlin Android App

KidsDrawingApp is a native Android application developed using the Kotlin programming language. It serves as a digital canvas for users to unleash their creativity and express themselves through drawing on their phone screens. The app offers a range of features and customization options to enhance the drawing experience.

One of the primary functionalities of KidsDrawingApp is the ability to select the brush size. Users can choose from a variety of brush sizes to create different stroke widths and effects. This allows for precise detailing or broader strokes, depending on the user's preference and artistic vision.

Another key feature of the app is the option to customize the color of the brush. Users have access to a wide color palette, enabling them to select their desired hue and create vibrant and visually appealing drawings. The ability to experiment with different colors empowers users to bring their imaginations to life.

KidsDrawingApp also provides the functionality to import images directly into the canvas. This feature allows users to incorporate existing images as reference or as part of their drawings. It offers a dynamic and interactive experience by combining digital drawing with existing visual elements.

To Preserve and share their artwork, users can download the result of their drawing and save it directly onto their phones. This feature ensures that their creations can be easily accessed and enjoyed at any time. Additionally, it enables users to share their artwork with others or use it for various purposes, such as printing or social media sharing.

The App includes a redo functionality, allowing users to undo and redo their drawing actions effortlessly. This feature provides flexibility and the opportunity to make adjustments or corrections without starting the drawing from scratch. It ensures a smooth and user-friendly experience, enhancing the overall workflow of creating art on a digital platform.

KidsDrawingApp was developed as a personal project to showcase and further enhance my proficiency in mobile application development. Through this project, I honed my skills in Kotlin programming and gained valuable experience in building native Android apps. The app demonstrates my ability to implement various functionalities, utilize user interfaces effectively, and optimize the drawing experience for mobile devices.

Overall, KidsDrawingApp is an engaging and feature-rich native Android app that enables users to explore their artistic side through digital drawing. With its brush customization, image import, download functionality, and redo capability, the app offers a versatile platform for users to create and save their artwork on their mobile devices
